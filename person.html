		<h2 id="bio">A very brief biography</h2>
			<p>I was born and grew up in anglophone Ontario, but both my parents were French, so I grew up bilingual</p>
		<h2 id="books">A longstanding love of books</h2>
			<p>Normally, parents celebrate if their child loves reading. Mine did too, until they started getting calls from teachers about me reading in class. Every day, I waged a silent struggle with the teachers. They would notice me reading and confiscate my book; I learned to come prepared and brought multiple books to school. Needless to say, the teachers were not pleased.</p>
			<p>My favourite genres have always been a blend of mythology, historical and fantasy books, with science-fiction finding a place on my bookshelves in early adolescence.</p>
